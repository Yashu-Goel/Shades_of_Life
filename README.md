Express, explore and heal with palette of happiness

Art allows us to show how we really feel . It never judges us and we can be the true version of ourself without any fear and complexities . 
As we move forward in the 21st century people are still intertwined with problems like low self-esteem , no control over emotions , anxiety , stress and many more .
This is where the art comes for the aid . Through the realms of creativity and imagination , a person can truly express himself and look out for solutions to hurdles he faces in his personal or professional life . 
Therefore , we the team Miraverse have created a platform for those who seek the path to happiness through art therapy and counseling . We have made a web application where a user can anonymously login and can communicate to a well trained chat bot which will guide him about the instructions . 
The art therapy activity is based on the theories of psychoanalysis . The task stresses upon the creation process of the art where the user goes on the journey to delve into their inner thoughts and emotions by the use of various colors and symbols . The tenets of process involve creativity, reconciling emotional conflicts, fostering self-awareness, and personal growth. 
Rightly said “ art is a language of self- exploration , expression  and healing “ .
